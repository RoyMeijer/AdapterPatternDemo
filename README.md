# Adapter Pattern in Java Spring

This repository hosts resources from my talk on implementing the Adapter Pattern in a Java Spring application. The focus was on adapting data from one format to another, exemplified by converting weather data formats.

## Overview

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that enables incompatible interfaces to work together. The talk demonstrated its utility in software design, particularly in integrating new functionalities into existing systems without altering the core application.

## Key Concepts

During the talk, several key concepts related to the Adapter Pattern were covered:

- **RestTemplate Usage:** How to use Spring's `RestTemplate` to fetch data from external APIs.
- **Message Converters:** Implementing custom message converters in Spring for handling different data formats.
- **Adapter Implementation:** Creating an adapter to convert data from one format to another, such as from Metric to Imperial measurement systems.
